# Clojure + Minecraft Workshop, ClojureD 2022

Instructions and sample code for the
[Witchcraft](https://github.com/lambdaisland/witchcraft) (Clojure+Minecraft)
workshop given at ClojureD, June 2022.

## Setup

We are going to use the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) modded Minecraft server,
and add to it the
[witchcraft-plugin](https://github.com/lambdaisland/witchcraft-plugin) which
will supply an nREPL inside the Minecraft process that we can then connect to.
